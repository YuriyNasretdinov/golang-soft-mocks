# Soft Mocks for Go!

This is Soft Mocks analogue ( https://github.com/badoo/soft-mocks ) for Golang.
This is an example of how it works:


```
$ go get github.com/YuriyNasretdinov/golang-soft-mocks
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/YuriyNasretdinov/golang-soft-mocks
$ ./run-example.sh # rewrites everything in GOPATH and GOROOT to a separate directory
File is going to be closed: /dev/null
Hello, world: %v! <nil>
```
